Final Project:

Today you will be creating a banking simulator with the MVC format. With this banking simulator a user should be able to:

	1. Create an account (Creates a new user and bank account)

	2. Log into an account 

	3. Exit the program

Once a user has logged in they should be presented with a new menu:

	1. Withdraw money from account (This should remove money from the user's account)

	2. Deposit money to account (This should add money to a user's account)

	3. Get account information (This should return all information about this account (id, balance) )

	4. Transfer money to another account (This should transfer money to another account by account number[id])

	5. Log out (This should return the user to the previous menu)

Before you write any code or pseudocode I want you to first design your database using the Schema Designer (http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/). Once you have your Schema designed then you should begin your pseudocode.
