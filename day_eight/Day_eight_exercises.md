Exercise 1:

Add a menu to the MVC version of CreditCard Validator. The menu should have the following options:

	1. Enter A Creditcard number (This should take in a creditcard from the user)

	2. Check the Creditcard (This should validate the card and print the card name and if the card is valid or not)

	3. Exit (This should end the program. Selecting any other option should return you to the menu.)


Exercise 2:

Create a shopping list program that uses the MVC. This program should track a user's shopping list. Theey should be able to add items to the list and check them off as they "shop".

This program should have a menu that has the following options:

	1. Create a note (This should create an item on a shopping list and store it in your dictionary)

	2. Display list (This should show each item, the id of the item, and if the item is checked off on the list yet.

	3. Check off an item (This should take in an id and if it is a valid id then it should check the item off on your list)

	4. Uncheck an item (This is the opposite of check off an item)

	5. Exit (This should end the program. Selecting any other option should return you to the menu.)

Before you write any code use the Schema Designer to figure out what tables you need and what columns each table needs.

Exercise 3:

Using the web scrapping lecture notes as a base create a function that scrapes the S&P 500 Futures Settlements (http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/e-mini-sandp500_quotes_settlements_futures.html) and prints out each row of the table in order.

Exercise 4:

Using the MCV format take the traffic.txt file from day 3 and insert each line into the database. Then write a function that reads each line of the database and outputs the average times of each room as in day 3 exercise 4.

Exercise 5:

Using the MVC format write a game that mimics Hangman (images not needed). You should be able to enter a word/sentence and have other "players" begin guessing letters. On a correct guess all instances of that letter in the word/sentence should be revealed. On an incorrect guess the wrong letter is added to a tally of wrong guesses, the players only have 5 wrong guesses before a game over. This does not need a database but you should have a class that models the hangman game's variables including the word, incorrect letters, and correct letters.

Exercise 6:

Using your webscraping lecture notes write a program that takes in a word from a user and finds its definitions using dictionary.com. To search for a specific word use http://www.dictionary.com/browse/word. Remember, use inspect to find the right target, we want all of the definitions not just one.
