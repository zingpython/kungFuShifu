Exercise 1:

Add a menu to the MVC version of CreditCard Validator. The menu should have the following options:

	1. Enter A Creditcard number (This should take in a creditcard from the user)

	2. Check the Creditcard (This should validate the card and print the card name and if the card is valid or not)

	3. Exit (This should end the program. Selecting any other option should return you to the menu.)


Exercise 2:

Create a shopping list program that uses the MVC. This program should track a user's shopping list. Theey should be able to add items to the list and check them off as they "shop".

This program should have a menu that has the following options:

	1. Create a note (This should create an item on a shopping list and store it in your dictionary)

	2. Display list (This should show each item, the id of the item, and if the item is checked off on the list yet.

	3. Check off an item (This should take in an id and if it is a valid id then it should check the item off on your list)

	4. Uncheck an item (This is the opposite of check off an item)

	5. Exit (This should end the program. Selecting any other option should return you to the menu.)

Before you write any code use the Schema Designer to figure out what tables you need and what columns each table needs.
