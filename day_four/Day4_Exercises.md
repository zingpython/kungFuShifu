Exercise 1. 

Using the code from Exercises 1 and 2 of Day Three convert these programs into functions that can be used in your code.

Exercise 2. 

Create a function that can convert an integer to its Binary equivalent. How to convert to a Binary Number(https://www.wikihow.com/Convert-from-Decimal-to-Binary) [Use method 1]

Exercise 3. 

In the same file as Exercise 2 create a function that takes a Binary value and converts it to an integer.


Exercise 4. 
Create a class that represents a bucket

	- For example, it can have three attributes:
	
		- name
	
		- max volume
	
		- current volume





Exercise 5. 

Add a function that uses the class created in the previous exercise so you can transfer volume from one bucket to another but not exceede the  max volume of a bucket.

Exercise 6. 

Create a class that represents a Circle. The Circle's initialization function should only require the radius but it should also set the area and permeter of the circle. 

Include two methods: one to calculate the area of the circle and one to calculate the perimeter of the circle.

Exercise 7. 

Lets simulate a space ship. We can assume that our spaceship is traveling through space towards a specific point in space that is represented with an X and Y coordinate. It is traveling at a specific velocity. Create a class that can contain the information about the spaceship. The space ship needs to be able to hold the following properties:

		Its current X and Y position

		The target's X and Y position

		Its current Speed

		And its name.

In addition write a function that advanced it towards the target by its speed, and a function that calculates how many times it needs to move its speed before it reaches its target.
